
Queue : one-to-one(one producer -> Queue -> one consumer)(if one producer -> Queue - > many consumers then message distribution follows RoundRobin fashion i.e 1st message to 1st consumer and then 2nd msg to 2nd consumer and so on )
Topic : one-to-many(pub-sub model  that means one producer -> Topic - > many consumers . Here all consumers gets same message )
Credentials.properties : these properties are used by webconsole(localhost:8161) and others to access Brokers. Thats why we need to give broker credentials inside this properties file.
activemq.xml : used to create brokers , provide authorization and authentication to the brokers created .

Default port of ActiveMQ is 8161 port
by default username : admin
by default password : admin

NOTE : with broker url only we will produce/consume messges into queue

Authentication and Authorization for broker url:
================================================

<authorizationEntry queue=">" read="users_name/groups_name"  write="users_name/groups_name" admin="users_name/groups_name"> 

queue=">"                      means for all users
read="users_name/groups_name"  means consuming message access to mentioned users/groups
write="users_name/groups_name" means producing message into queue access to mentioned users/groups
admin="users_name/groups_name" means admin acess like deleting etc to mentioned users

<authorizationEntry topic=">" read="users_name/groups_name"  write="users_name/groups_name" admin="users_name/groups_name"> 
same as queue

used in course:

<plugins>
			<!-- Configure authentication; Username, passwords and groups -->
			<simpleAuthenticationPlugin>
				<users>
					<authenticationUser username="admin" password="admin" groups="admins"/>
				</users>
			</simpleAuthenticationPlugin>

			<!--  Lets configure a destination based authorization mechanism -->
			<authorizationPlugin>
				<map>
					<authorizationMap>
						<authorizationEntries>
							<authorizationEntry queue=">" read="admins" write="admins" admin="admins" />
							<authorizationEntry topic=">" read="admins" write="admins" admin="admins" />
						</authorizationEntries>
					</authorizationMap>
				</map>
			</authorizationPlugin>
		</plugins>
		
Connection:
		
 localhost:8161  is for ActiveMQ WebConsole
 tcp://localhost:61616 is for ActiveMQ Broker
		
 ActiveMQConnetionFactory(Broker username , Broker password , Broker url)
 ActiveMQConnetionFactory(admin1, admin2 , "tcp://localhost:61616")
